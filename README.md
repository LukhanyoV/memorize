# Memorize 

## Things to do
* add count up timer, to know how long player has played for (✅)
* Work on feedback on game over (⭕️)
* Play the sequence using NumPad (number pad) on a keyboard [this is to make it easier for me to play the game using a computer keyboard] (❓️) 

## Notes
* Game is now playable, but still needs some work 🚀
* Better to play on a touch screen (at least it becomes tiring for me to move mouse around) 😴
* Name change to magic sequence / knock code?🤔
