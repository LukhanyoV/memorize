# Memorize 

## Things to do
* add count up timer, to know how long player has played for (busy with this)
* Work on feedback on game over
* Play the sequence using NumPad (number pad) on a keyboard (optional) [this is to make it easier for me to play the game using a computer keyboard]

## Notes
* Game is now playable, but still needs some work
* Better to play on a touch screen (at least it becomes tiring for me to move mouse around)
